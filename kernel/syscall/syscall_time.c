 * If selector is 0, the time is all ticks since kernel bootup.
 * If selector is 1, the time is ticks on the current cpu since bootup.
 * If selector is 2, the time is ticks on the current process.
 * If selector is 3, the time is ticks on the current thread.
 * If selector is 4, the value is nanoseconds per tick.
